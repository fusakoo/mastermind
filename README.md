# Mastermind
CLI-based [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) game built in Ruby

<!--
### Features
- Colorized pegs using the Colorize gem

### TODO
- Colorize the command line from a ruby script
    - see if the colorize methods can be consolidated


### Bug log 


### Things I learned
- Better understanding of accessing variables in different classes (@ and @@ variables)
- Leveraging gem to implement feature (i.e. CLI colorization)
- Writing overall structure as pseudocode to better gain overall understanding of logic
