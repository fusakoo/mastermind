# Mastermind
CLI-based [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) game built in Ruby.

### Features
V1: Codebreaker mode available now (10/06/2020)
- 12-turn based Mastermind game with feedback mechanism
- Colorized pegs using the Colorize gem

### TODO
- Implement Codemaker mode (vs Computer)

### Bug log 
- Codemaker mode: undefined method bug 


### Things I learned
- Better understanding of accessing variables in different classes (@ and @@ variables)
- Leveraging gem to implement feature (i.e. CLI colorization)
- Writing overall structure as pseudocode to better gain overall understanding of logic
- Instance method vs Class Method, and how module method interacts/merges into one another
- sleep(*args) to 'animate' the computer thought process
